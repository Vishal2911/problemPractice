Jon is playing Ludo. According to the rules of Ludo, a player can enter a new token into the play only when he rolls a 6 on the die.
In the current turn, Jon rolled the number X on the die. Determine if Jon can enter a new token into the play in the current turn or not.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains one integer X — the number rolled by the Jon on the die. 

Output Format
For each test case, output YES if the Jon can enter a new token in the game. Otherwise, output NO.
You may print each character of YES and NO in uppercase or lowercase (for example, yes, yEs, Yes will be considered identical).
