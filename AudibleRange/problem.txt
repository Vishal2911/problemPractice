Charlie's dog binary hears frequencies starting from 67 Hertz to 45000 Hertz (both inclusive).

If Charlie's commands have a frequency of X Hertz, find whether binary can hear them or not.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single integer X - the frequency of Charlie's commands in Hertz.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line YES, if binary can hear Charlie's commands. Otherwise, print NO.
The output is case-insensitive. Thus, the strings YES, yes, yeS, and Yes are all considered the same.

Sample 1:
Input                                                     Output
5                                                            NO
42                                                           YES 
67                                                           YES
402                                                          YES
45000                                                         NO
45005                                                         
Explanation:
Test case 1: Charlie's command has a frequency of 42 Hertz which is less than 67. Thus, it would not be audible to binary.
Test case2: Charlie's command has a frequency of 67 Hertz which lies in the range [67,45000]. Thus, it would be audible to binary. 
Test case 3: Charlie's command has a frequency of 402 Hertz which lies in the range 402 Hertz which lies in the range [67,45000].Thus,it would be audible to binary. 
Test case 4: Charlie's command has a frequency of 45000 Hertz which lies in the range [67,45000]. Thus, it would be audible to binary.
Test case 5: Charlie's command has a frequency of 45005 Hertz which is greater than 45000. Thus, it would not be audible to binary.
