Chandu has recently moved into an apartment. It takes 30 minutes for Chandu to reach office from the apartment.
Chandu left for the office X minutes before Chandu was supposed to reach. Determine whether or not Chandu will be able to reach on time.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single integer X.

Output Format
For each test case, output YES if Chandu will reach on time, NO otherwise.
The output is case-insensitive. Thus, the strings YES, yes, yeS, and Yes are all considered the same.

Explanation:
Test case 1: Chandu leaves 30 minutes before he is supposed to reach, so he will reach the office exactly on time since it takes 30 minutes to commute.
Test case 2: Chandu will reach 30 minutes early.
Test case 3: Chandu will reach 16 minutes late.
