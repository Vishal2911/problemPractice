For each test case, output on a new line the number of students who won't be able to book tickets.
 
Sample 1:
Input                                                   Output
4                                                          2  
5 3                                                        0
5 7                                                        3    
4 1                                                        0   
8 8                                                         
Explanation:
Test case 1: There are 5 students who want to go, and only 3 tickets are available. Hence 2 students won't be able to get tickets.
Test case 2: There are 5 students who want to go, and 7 tickets are available. So, every one of them will get the tickets.
Test case 3: There are 4 students who want to go, and only 1 ticket is available. Hence 3 students won't be able to get tickets.
Test case 4: There are 8 students who want to go, and 8 tickets are available. So, every one of them will get the tickets.
