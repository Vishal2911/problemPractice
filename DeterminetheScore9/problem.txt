Sonu appeared for a placement test.
There is a problem worth X points. Sonu finds out that the problem has exactly10 test cases. It is known that each test case is worth the same number of points.
Sonu passesN test cases among them. Determine the score Sonu will get. 
NOTE: See sample explanation for more clarity.

Input Format
First line will contain T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains of a single line of input, two integers X and N, the total points for the problem and the number of test cases which pass for Sonu's solution.

Output Format
For each test case, output the points scored by Sonu.

Sample 1:
Input                                                 Output
4                                                       3
10 3                                                    100
100 10                                                  52
130 4                                                   0
70 0
Explanation:
Test Case 1: The problem is worth 10 points and since there are 10 test cases, each test case is worth 1 point. Since Sonu passes 3 test cases, his score will be 1⋅3=3 points.
Test Case2: The problem is worth 100 points and since there are 10 test cases, each test case is worth 10 points. Since Sonu passes all the 10⋅10=100 points.
Test Case 3: The problem is worth 130 points and since there are 10 test cases, each test case is worth 13 points. Since Sonu passes 4 test cases, his score will be 13⋅4=52 points.
Test Case 4: The problem is worth 70 points and since there are 10 test cases, each test case is worth 10 test cases, each test case is worth 7 points. Since Sonu passes 0 test cases, his score will be 7⋅0=0 points.
