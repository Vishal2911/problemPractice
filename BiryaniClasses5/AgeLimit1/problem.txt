Problem
Ram wants to appear in a competitive exam. To take the exam, there are following requirements:
Minimum age limit is X (i.e. Age should be greater than or equal to X).
Age should be strictly less than Y.
Ram's current Age is A. Find whether he is currently eligible to take the exam or not.

Input Format
First line will contain T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing three integers X,Y, and A as mentioned in the statement.

Output Format
For each test case, output YES if Ram is eligible to give the exam, NO otherwise.
You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YES, yEs, yes, and yeS will all be treated as identical).

Sample 1:
Input                                                                   Output
5                                                                          YES
21 34 30                                                                   NO
25 31 31                                                                   YES
22 29 25                                                                   NO
20 40 15                                                                   YES

Explanation:

Test case 1: The age of Ram is 30.His age satisfies the minimum age limit as 30≥21. Also, it is less than the upper limit as 30<34. Thus, Ram is eligible to take the exam.
Test case 2: The age of Ram is 31. His age satisfies the minimum age limit as 31≥25. But, it is not less than the upper limit as 31≮31. Thus, Ram is not eligible to take the exam.
Test case 3: The age of Ram is 25. His age satisfies the minimum age limit as 25≥22. Also, it is less than the upper limit as 25<29. Thus, Ram is eligible to take the exam.
Test case4: The age of Ram is 15. His age does not satisfy the minimum age limit as  15<20. Thus, Ram is not eligible to take the exam.
